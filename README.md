### Summary

**The Promptology Manifesto** is a living document that explores how language becomes emotion â€” and how information begins to *feel*.  
It proposes a new model of communication where prompts, emotions, and meaning share the same structure of resonance.  
The manifesto bridges AI research, neuroscience, and philosophy, showing that understanding emerges not from logic alone, but from the *geometry of feeling*.
