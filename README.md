### Summary

**The Promptology Manifesto** is a living research document exploring how language transforms into emotion — and how information begins to *feel*.  
It combines philosophical reasoning with experimental AI studies, conceptual modeling, and neuro-inspired simulations of affective states.  
Promptology proposes that meaning is not computed but *emerges* — as resonance between syntax, intention, and emotion.
